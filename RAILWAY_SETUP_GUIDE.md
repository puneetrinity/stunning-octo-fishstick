# Complete Railway Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Railway Project Created Successfully!

Your Railway project has been created:
- **Project Name**: chat-seo-platform-new
- **Project URL**: https://railway.com/project/f3f0a5aa-0cbd-4e44-b644-5765c20a8fad

## Quick Setup Steps

### Option 1: Web Dashboard (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Visit your project**: https://railway.com/project/f3f0a5aa-0cbd-4e44-b644-5765c20a8fad

2. **Add PostgreSQL**:
   - Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically create and configure the database
   - `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically injected

3. **Deploy your app**:
   - Click "New" â†’ "GitHub Repo" 
   - Select your `stunning-octo-fishstick` repository
   - Railway will automatically deploy

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key
   ```

### Option 2: CLI Commands

```bash
# 1. Deploy your application
cd /home/ews/chat-seo-platform
railway up

# 2. Add PostgreSQL (may require web dashboard)
# Visit the web dashboard to add PostgreSQL service

# 3. Set environment variables
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
railway variables set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Option 3: Use the Deploy Script

```bash
./railway-deploy.sh
```

## What Happens After Setup

1. **Automatic Database Connection**: Your app will automatically detect Railway's PostgreSQL
2. **SSL/TLS**: Automatically configured by Railway
3. **Custom Domain**: Available in Railway dashboard
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in logs and metrics

## Verification

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check with database status
- `GET /docs` - API documentation

## Environment Variables You'll Need

### Required for Full Functionality:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # For ChatGPT monitoring
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # For Claude monitoring  
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...           # For Gemini monitoring
```

### Optional:
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=...           # Auto-generated if not set
DEBUG=false                  # Production mode
ENVIRONMENT=production       # Environment type
```

### Automatically Set by Railway:
```
DATABASE_URL=...             # PostgreSQL connection string
PORT=...                     # Application port
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Database Connection Fails:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in Railway dashboard
2. Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables
3. The app will run in demo mode if database is unavailable

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all required files are in repository
3. Verify `railway.json` and `start.sh` are present

### Check Logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the application** with the provided endpoints
2. **Set up monitoring** in Railway dashboard
3. **Configure custom domain** if needed
4. **Add Redis** for caching (optional):
   - Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add Redis"

## Project Structure

Your Railway project will have:
- **Web Service**: Your FastAPI application
- **PostgreSQL**: Database service with automatic `DATABASE_URL`
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration
- **Automatic SSL**: HTTPS enabled by default
- **Git Integration**: Auto-deploy on GitHub pushes
